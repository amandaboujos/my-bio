        <h2>My Goals</h2>

        <p>I have a lot of really high goals set for myself, realistically I know I will never be able to achieve them all but I am definitely going to work as hard as I can to b able to succeed in most. My main goal that I strive to aim for is opening my own business one day. Me and two of my closest friends are in fields of study that would allow us to one day open a firm that we could incorporate all fields into. It will be a company that will incorporate Architecture Design with Virtual Reality and Augmented reality with Real Estate. I know we have a long way to go to get there with a lot of learning, planning and organization but with us all being very motivated and we have all had this dream for a very long time now I know with hard work and dedication we will get there one day!</p>
